# Face Detection in C++ using OpenCV
This repository contains a C++ implementation of face detection using the OpenCV library. Face detection is an essential task in computer vision, and this project demonstrates how to utilize the power of OpenCV to detect faces in images and videos.

# Features
# OpenCV Integration: The project leverages the OpenCV library to perform efficient and accurate face detection.

# Image and Video Support: The code can handle both static images and videos, making it versatile for various use cases.

# Haar Cascade Classifier: The project employs a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection. This classifier is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness.

# Easy to Use: With clear code comments and a straightforward structure, this project is perfect for both beginners and experienced programmers.

# Student Record Management System in C++
This project is a Student Record Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manage student records using file management techniques. The program provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student information.

# Features
# Add Student Record: Users can input details like name, roll number, marks, etc., to add a new student record to the system.

# Update Student Record: Existing student records can be updated by providing the roll number and modifying the necessary information.

# Delete Student Record: Users can delete a student record using the roll number, removing the student's information from the system.

# Display Student Records: The system can display all the student records stored in the file, showing details such as name, roll number, and marks.

# Search for Student: Users can search for a specific student's record using their roll number.
